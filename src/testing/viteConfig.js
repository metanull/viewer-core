/**
 * The shared Vite configuration for viewer websites, returning a config object
 * ready to pass to `defineConfig()`. The seven websites duplicate this shape:
 * the `@inventory-data` alias to the data package, `optimizeDeps` to inline
 * the viewer packages, `testTimeout`, and the test environment.
 *
 * `dataPackage` is the npm package name, e.g. `'@metanull/islamicart-data'`.
 * `inline` is an optional array of extra packages to inline in tests, beyond
 * the required `'@metanull/viewer-core'` and `'@metanull/viewer-layout'`.
 * `plugins` is an optional array of Vite plugins (e.g. `@vitejs/plugin-vue`),
 * which the site must supply because this package does not depend on them.
 * `root` is an optional project root path (default `process.cwd()`); use it when
 * loading the config from a context other than the project directory.
