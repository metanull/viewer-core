// The whole of it: look a key up in the active language, fall back to English,
// and return the key itself when neither has it, so a missing text shows up as
// its own name rather than as a blank page.
//
// The scope of this module is frozen. It does lookup, fallback and reactivity;
// it will never grow interpolation, pluralisation or a message format. A text
// is a text — a value produced at run time is rendered by the component next
// to the text, never inside it. A future need outside that is a different
// system, not an extension of this one.

// Symbol.for, not Symbol: this module is reachable through two specifiers —
// `@metanull/viewer-core` (which createViewer imports relatively) and
// `@metanull/viewer-core/i18n` (which viewer-layout imports) — and a bundler
// that resolves them to two module instances would create two distinct keys.
// The application would then provide one and the layout inject the other,
// which reads as "no texts installed" in a package that plainly installed
// them. A key from the global registry is the same key in every instance.
