// The country chronology (`hcr` in legacy) is one merged, year-ordered list
// per country, served by legacy `/v2/events` and reproduced identically on
// every gallery and standalone site. An exhibition can instead carry its own
// narrative chronology (`source: 'thg_local'` — legacy's `/thg/timeline`),
// which has no country of its own and is never interleaved with the merge.
// Sharing History's Timeline additionally splits the merge by the exhibition
// each event belongs to (`collection_id` on its timeline row, `null` for the
// Permanent Collection). Every one of the seven websites' Timeline pages is
// one of these three axes over the same event shape — this is the one place
// that shape is read.
//
// The event overlap rule was triplicated verbatim (islamicart, baroqueart,
// sharinghistory) and mirrors legacy `class.hcr.inc.php`'s SQL; carpets and
// water-in-islam wrote a related but distinct copy for the DXA sites. Both
// are ported here rather than merged into a fourth variant, because the two
// already ship identical answers on the cases that matter (see the tests):
// the only real divergence was which of the three label rules a site reached
// for, which is now one function trying all three in the order the data
// disambiguates them.
//
// What stays out, by design: the DXA legacy 2-letter country code
// (`legacyCodeOf`/`nameFor` in carpets and water-in-islam) — parsing
// `backward_compatibility` and falling back to `Intl.DisplayNames` is a
// concern of the sites still keying their Timeline URLs on that code, not of
// the merge itself. Those sites pass `countryIdForCode` to translate their
// code back to the id this module filters on.
